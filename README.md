# Releasing

Releasing is done via the `maven-release-plugin` and `nexus-staging-plugin` which are configured via the
`release` [profile](https://github.com/spotify/semantic-metrics/blob/master/pom.xml#L140). Deploys are staged in oss.sonatype.org before being deployed to Maven Central. Check out the [maven-release-plugin docs](http://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/) and the [nexus-staging-plugin docs](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager2) for more information. 

To release, first run: 

``mvn -P release release:prepare``

You will be prompted for the release version and the next development version. On success, follow with:
